-- YOU ARE WELCOME TO SQL CLASS--
-- INTRODUCTION TO STRUCTURAL QUERY LANGUAGE
-- OBJECTIVE OF THE COURSE
-- 1. TO UNDERSTAND A RELATIONAL DATABASE
-- 2. TO UNDERSTAND SQL
-- 3. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU CAN DO TO A RELATIONAL DATABASE USING SQL

-- A RDB IS A COLLECTION OF DATA STORED IN TABLES. A TABLE CONTAIN COLUMNS AND ROWS.
-- TABLE NAMES MUST BE UNIQUE WITHIN A DATABASE. Table name must starts with a letter while other character can be combinations of letters, characters and numbers
-- The rows of a table does not have a name and their position is not fixed in the table

-- SQL is the most popular relational database language. Its full meaning is STRUCTURAL QUERY LANGUAGE. It can also be called "SEQUEL"
-- IT WAS DEVELOPED BY IBM TEAM IN 1974. 

-- SQL CONSIST OF SIX BASIC STATEMENTS (CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DROP, DELETE). THEY CAN BE GROUPED INTO THREE CATEGORIES
-- DEFINITION STATEMENT---- (CREATE, DROP). CREATE IS USED TO DEFINE NEW TABLE, DATABASE, VIEWS, INDICES, ETC. DROP STATEMENT REMOVES THIS COMPONENTS WHEN THEY ARE NO LONGER NEEDED
-- MAINTENANCE STATEMENT --- (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) INSERT CREATE NEW SINGLE OR MULTIPLE ROWS IN A TABLE, UPDATE MODIFY THE VALUES IN A ROW, DELETE REMOVES A ROW FROM THE TABEL
-- QUERY STATEMENT ----- (SELECT). IT IS USED TO FORMULATE ALL THE QUERIES. TO ASK QUESTIONS THAT ALL THE ANSWERS ARE IN THE TABLE OR MULTIPLE TABLES OF A DATABASE

-- A SQL STATEMENT CONTAIN A COLLECTION OF CLAUSES, KEYWORDS, AND PARAMETERS THAT FORMS A PARTICULAR FUNCTION
-- E.G. SELECT column FROM table WHERE column comparison

-- CLAUSES
-- VARIOUS CLAUSES IN SQL ARE NAMED AFTER THEIR INITIAL WORDS. EACH CLAUSE SHOULD BE WRITTEN ON A SINGLE LINE FOR CLARITY
-- EXAMPLE OF CLAUSES ARE SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, ETC.

-- Keywords
-- This are reserved words that are used for special purposes. they are not to be used as column names or table names
-- they can be written in lowercase, uppercase or mixed case --

-- Parameters
-- These are the variable parts of a SQL statement. they are the table names, column names

-- constraints
-- Constraints in SQL are used to define rules for data stored in a table. They help maintain accuracy, integrity, and reliability by limiting what type of data can be entered into the table. If any violations occur between the constraint 
-- rules and the action performed on that specific piece of data, then it will not complete successfully. 
-- Constraints may be specified at either column or table level. -- 
-- 7 major constraints are
-- NOT NULL: stop blank or null values from being entered into a certain column of an SQL table,
-- UNIQUE : The UNIQUE constraint prevents the same value from being entered twice into a specified column.
-- PRIMARY KEY : A primary key of a database table serves as a unique identifier for each row.
-- It must have distinct values and cannot be null, combining the NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints --
-- FOREIGN KEY: A foreign key is a type of field in one table that links it to another by referencing the primary key of the other. 
-- This allows for each row in both tables to be identified uniquely through this link between them
-- CHECK : The CHECK constraint is one of the types of constraints in SQL that can be used to make sure that data meets certain requirements before it is inserted into a table
-- DEFAULT : When you use the DEFAULT constraint with a SQL column, it will automatically insert the specified default value when no other value is provided.
-- This means that if someone tries to add data without specifying any values for this particular column, then the DEFAULT value set up by you will be used instead.
 -- It helps ensure columns have some value in them and can help prevent unexpected empty fields from appearing in your database tables.
-- CREATE INDEX: In SQL, the CREATE INDEX constraint is used to make it easier for a database system to quickly retrieve data. 
-- This works like an index in a book where each page has its number or heading and you can find information faster by just looking at the numbers instead of reading through every single page one by one

-- DATA TYPE
-- Data types define the type of value a column can hold, such as numbers, text, or dates
-- It ensures that data is stored efficiently and accurately.
-- why you need to choose the right data type
-- Data Integrity: Prevents invalid data from being entered into the database (e.g., storing text in a numeric column).
-- Efficient Storage: Reduces storage costs by allocating only the necessary space for data.
-- Query Performance: Improves query performance by enabling faster indexing and search operations.
-- Application Compatibility: Ensures smooth interaction between the database and applications by enforcing consistency in data handling.
-- float, int,  char, varchar(non-unicode with max length of 8000), tinyint, bigint, date, time,datetime, decimal, text, real, Nchar, Nvarchar(unicode with max lentgh of 4000)
-- binary, bit, image, boolean, geometry, xml.

-- USING THE ALTER STATEMENT
-- The SQL ALTER TABLE statement is a powerful tool that allows you to modify the structure of an existing table
-- in a database. Whether youâ€™re adding new columns, modifying existing ones, deleting columns, or renaming them, 
-- the ALTER TABLE statement enables you to make changes without losing the data stored in the table. --

-- some of the use cases of the Alter statement
-- ADD CLAUSE: To add a new column into an existing table
-- here is the syntax
-- ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name datatype;
-- to add a single column to a table
-- ALTER TABLE performance_table ADD Remarks  VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL;
-- update performance_table set Remarks="Very Good" where performance_id=1
-- -- to add multiple columns to a table
-- ALTER TABLE staff_table
-- ADD staff_level INT NOT NULL,
-- ADD staff_level_title varchar(50) NOT NULL;

-- MODIFY COLUMN CLAUSE: is used to modify the data definition of an existing column, such as changing its data type or size
-- here is the syntax
-- ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY COLUMN column_name datatype;
-- example
-- ALTER TABLE Student_table MODIFY COLUMN First_name CHAR(50),
-- MODIFY COLUMN Last_name CHAR(50);

-- DROP COLUMN Clause: To delete an existing column from the table. 
-- DROP COLUMN will permanently remove the column and its data, therefore, becareful when using it.
-- here is the syntax
-- ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;
-- example
-- ALTER TABLE student_table ADD Total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL;
-- ALTER TABLE  student_table DROP COLUMN total_amount;
-- RENAME COLUMN Clause: This is used to rename an existing column
-- this means that you are changing the name of the column without a loss to the existing data type and content
-- here is the syntax
-- ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN old_name TO new_name;
-- example
-- ALTER TABLE performance_table RENAME COLUMN student_id TO student_ID;

-- RENAME TO Clause-  This is used to rename the table itself
-- here is the syntax
-- ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME TO new_table_name;
-- example
-- ALTER TABLE  staff_table RENAME TO staff_table2;

-- ADD CONSTRAINT Clause- This is used to add any constraint to a column, such as if a table has no primary key before
-- we can use ADD CONSTRAINT clause to add a primary key constraint to a column
-- here is the syntax
-- ALTER TABLE table_name ADD CONSTRAINT column_name CONSTRAINT (column_name);
-- example
-- ALTER TABLE subject_table ADD CONSTRAINT student_id UNIQUE (student_id)
-- CHECK, PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, FOREIGN KEY are the supported constraints
-- ALTER TABLE subject_table ADD CONSTRAINT student_id PRIMARY KEY (student_id);
-- example
-- ALTER TABLE subject_table 
-- ADD CONSTRAINT staff_id 
-- FOREIGN KEY (staff_id) REFERENCES staff_table(staff_id);
-- to add a constraint check on a column
-- ALTER TABLE student_table ADD CONSTRAINT  Phone_number CHECK ( Phone_number = 11 );

-- ALTER CLAUSE: this alters the column directly
-- ALTER TABLE student_payment ALTER Amount_expected SET DEFAULT 100;
-- ALTER TABLE student_payment ALTER Amount_expected DROP DEFAULT;
